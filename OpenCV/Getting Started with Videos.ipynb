    "## Capture Video from Camera\n",
    "Often, we have to capture live stream with camera. OpenCV provides a very simple interface to this. Let’s capture a video from the camera (I am using the in-built webcam of my laptop), convert it into grayscale video and display it. Just a simple task to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture a video, you need to create a VideoCapture object. Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video file. Device index is just the number to specify which camera. Normally one camera will be connected (as in my case). So I simply pass 0 (or -1). You can select the second camera by passing 1 and so on. After that, you can capture frame-by-frame. But at the end, don’t forget to release the capture."

    "<b>cap.read()</b> returns a bool (True/False). If frame is read correctly, it will be True. So you can check end of the video by checking this return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, <b>cap</b> may not have initialized the capture. In that case, this code shows error. You can check whether it is initialized or not by the method <b>cap.isOpened()</b>. If it is True, OK. Otherwise open it using <b>cap.open()</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also access some of the features of this video using <b>cap.get(propId)</b> method where propId is a number from 0 to 18. Each number denotes a property of the video (if it is applicable to that video) and full details can be seen here: <a href=\"https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/highgui/doc/reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html#videocapture-get\">Property Identifier</a>. Some of these values can be modified using cap.set(propId, value). Value is the new value you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I can check the frame width and height by <b>cap.get(3)</b> and <b>cap.get(4)</b>. It gives me 640x480 by default. But I want to modify it to 320x240. Just use <b>ret = cap.set(3,320)</b> and <b>ret = cap.set(4,240)</b>.\n",
